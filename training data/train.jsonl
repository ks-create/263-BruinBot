Do you eat meals at regular times? Do you want to eat out in Westwood, KTown, etc? The main meal plans are 14r, 14p, 19r, 19p. r is regular and p is premium. Regular means that you can only use your meal for 1 meal period, and they will expire at the end of the week. p means that you aren't limited to when you can use your swipes and they will expire at the end of the quarter versus the week. So, if you have 19r, you: can eat 3 times a day for a week; if you eat 18 times for a week, you will lose the 1 meal once the week is over. Your counter will then reset to 19 meals, again can't eat lunch twice. If you have 19p, you: can eat two lunches in a day, if you feel like it; can eat 50 times in one week. You will just have to eat less or eat out towards the end of the quarter. The reason people choose the premium plans is mostly for flexibility and also allows you to swipe friends' food. Premium is more expensive than regular meal plans."}]}

In contrast, the premium plan offers more flexibility: swipes roll over from week to week, and multiple swipes can be used in a single meal period. This means you can get both a sandwich and a smoothie for lunch. The premium plan also allows taking friends to the dining halls. Many find the regular plan to be less cost-effective because of the limitations on swipes per meal period, making the premium plan a more flexible and valuable option."}]}

You can also choose apartments or commute! After the first two years, many students move off-campus into UCLA-affiliated or non-affiliated apartments, which are often more budget-friendly. On campus, there are various dorm types: classics, deluxes, plazas, and suites. Most students stay in triples, but doubles and singles are also available. Triples feature a bunk bed and a lofted bed with a desk and closet underneath. Doubles have two adjustable beds for more under-bed storage. Each dorm comes with plenty of storage options, including cabinets or closets, and each bed has a desk nearby or underneath, complete with storage and shelving. There's also a comfy wooden chair - you might want to bring a cushion from home! The energy-saving central lights turn off if no motion is detected for about half an hour, which can lead to fun, spontaneous study breaks. UCLA also offers Living Learning Communities (LLCs), themed dorm floors for students with similar interests, like Afrikan Diaspora and Pilipinx, or shared passions like Sustainability and Creative Collective.

They offer air conditioning, ample space, and plenty of storage without the high price tag of plazas or suites. Plus, they're in a prime location, close to campus and central on the Hill. You'll be near multiple campus eateries like Bruin Plate, Bruin Cafe, Cafe 1919, and the Hilltop Store, which has all your dorm essentials. Next up are the Rieber Terrace and Rieber Vista plazas. They mostly have shared bathrooms and offer spacious storage and room. If you're lucky, you might get a view of the line at Rendezvous, a popular eatery in Rieber Plaza. These dorms are central on the Hill, but be prepared to climb the notorious Death Steps to get to and from campus! While none of UCLA's housing options are terrible, classics like Dykstra, Rieber, and Hedrick Hall can feel a bit congested, especially since they're mostly freshman dorms. The bathrooms can get dirty on weekends, and the lack of air conditioning and space can feel claustrophobic at times. But don't worry, there are ample study spaces on the first floor and in the communal lounges. Rieber Hall is also close to Feast, a dine-in location, but the greasy smell of food can waft into your dorm if you're facing the wrong direction. Saxon or Hitch might not be the best choices for your first year either. They're secluded from campus and the rest of the Hill, and their separate buildings make it hard to meet neighbors. They're also far from Hill eateries, meaning it could take ten minutes just to get a snack from The Study. Sunset Village can feel isolating too, with its few dorms arranged in a circular format compared to halls with fifty or more dorms in a row. But remember, every dorm floor is unique, and there are perks to every location.

This central location is ideal, making it easy to go to the gym or favorite dining halls like BPlate.
