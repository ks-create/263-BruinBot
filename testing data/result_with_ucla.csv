9,"Question: Where are the best places to park a car at UCLA?
  Answer: If you're thinking of bringing a car to UCLA, then listen up! Parking on campus is a bit tricky, but there are three main types of parking permits: S, SR, and ST. S permits are the most expensive, but they're convenient because you can park at the residence halls. SR permits are cheaper and still allow you to park at the residence halls, but you might have to walk a bit further. ST permits are the cheapest and require parking in a separate lot across from UCLA. Many students opt for ST permits to save money, but be prepared for a 10-15 minute walk to your dorm. Many first-year students don't bring cars at all, and some choose to bring them only for winter and spring quarters. Something to consider is that parking can be challenging, and many structures are only accessible by a single path or require walking up steep hills. If you're thinking of having a car, you might want to join a carpool with students living in the same area. This way, they can drop you off near your dorm, and you won't have to worry about finding parking. As a general rule, the closer the parking structures are to the center of campus, the more valuable the permit. Be prepared that housing is typically offered by lottery after your first year, so there's no guarantee that you'll live closer to your classes in the coming years. The convenience of living near your residence halls might not always be available. Some areas like Sproul Cove and Sproul Landing, while very convenient, are more expensive and may fill up quickly. Many students living in Hedrick Summit, Rieber Vista, and De Neve Plaza will opt for the SR parking permits. Keep these tips in mind while planning your UCLA journey.

We're talking about real food‚Äîhomemade pasta, roasted chicken, hand-patted burgers, grilled vegetables, Pulitzer-winning quiches, and world-famous grilled cheese. When the staff heard that old-fashioned pizzas were no longer circulating, they flew in a master pizza maker from Naples who, after a short stay in quarantine in a little shack behind Sproul Hall, got to work. De Neve visitors were astounded to see huge wooden crates of genuine buffalo mozzarella, cases of Guanciale bacon, and over 55-gallon drums of olive oil and crushed tomatoes being unloaded onto the grassy plaza surrounding the De Neve dining room. In a following ceremony, attended by dignitaries from the Italian customs office and representatives of Slow Foods USA, the Neapolitan pizzeria was christened ""The Inferno."" Trained by the renowned chef Ottavio Shamblini, MamaLuigi, a third-generation pizzaiuolo, does not appear to have adopted our Westwood founding Hawaiian Pizza supplier's preference for pre-shredded mozzarella cheese substitutes.

After last call, long lines of students wait for their turn to settle into a candlelit booth, where a uniformed waitress delivers Chianti in an earthen bottle and fresh loaves of Ciabatta bread speckled with imported sea salt. The pies feature such toppings as poached quail eggs, arugula, purple peacock bacon, Asiago cheese, arrabbiata sauce, and chicken sausage. Management has requested that visitors refrain from bringing bicycles into the dining room as well as kayaks, but will provide free rubber boots for those that choose to arrive in any three-day deluge.

Whether a premium meal plan is worth it depends on individual preferences and dining habits. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Frequency of Dining on Campus**: If you plan to eat most of your meals on campus and want the convenience of not having to worry about meal preparation, a premium plan with more meals per week may be worth it.

2. **Variety and Flexibility**: Premium plans often come with more dining dollars, allowing you to have more options in terms of where you eat on campus. If you prefer more flexibility in your dining choices, a premium plan may be a good fit.

3. **Cost versus Savings**: Premium meal plans typically come at a higher cost compared to the basic plans. It's important to consider how much you will realistically spend on dining out of pocket if you opt for a lower-tier plan compared to the cost of upgrading to a premium plan.

4. **Utilizing Benefits**: Consider whether you will take advantage of the additional perks that come with a premium plan, such as guest meals, priority access, or exclusive dining events. If you think you will make use of these benefits, it may justify the higher cost.

Ultimately, the value of a premium meal plan will depend on your individual preferences, dining habits, and budget.
